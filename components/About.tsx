          As the Founder of <span className="text-accent font-semibold">OpportunitiX</span>, I lead a student-run initiative that empowers learners with access to exclusive career-building opportunitiesâ€”free courses, internships, and competitions. Through this, I've helped foster an inclusive and growth-focused learning community.

        <p>
          I thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments and am always eager to learn, build, and contribute. My long-term vision is to become a versatile AI/ML engineer who builds intelligent systems that are impactful, inclusive, and future-ready. Let's connect and create something meaningful together!
